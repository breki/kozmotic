# TODO

Ideas and tasks to be implemented next.

## Ideas

- [x] Prepare a GitHub Actions workflow to build and
  release new version of the binaries for Linux,
  Windows, and Mac

## Tasks

- [ ] Restructure code into smaller, more manageable
  modules (extract from single-file `src/main.rs`)
- [ ] Add Claude Code Stop hook to run `cargo clippy`
  on modified files and `cargo test`
